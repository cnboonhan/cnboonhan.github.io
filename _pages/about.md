I'm currently a Lead Engineer in Singapore's Home Team Science and Technology Agency. I work on building Vision Language Models and Infrastructure for AI in Robotics. 

Previously, I was in IBM Consulting as a DevOps Engineer, where I built and maintained Cloud and On-Premise Software Infrastructure. I also worked in Open Robotics and CHART on the Robotics Middleware Framework.

I put my random tinkering projects and thoughts / experiences in Blog, and more notable achievements under "Portfolio". Auf geht's!
